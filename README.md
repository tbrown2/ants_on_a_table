#Ants On a Table
This code was used as a final project in my data structures class. In this code I decided to experiment with node traversal. My code simulates two ant teams fighting eachother until one team finishes of the other team's queen. 

##Method
I could have easily coded this as a two dimensional matrix, representing the table, but instead as an experiment I used nodes to form a graph. At the beginning the user defines what the width/height will be. Depending on how big the two dimensional graph is, the performance of the program can take a very long time. 

##Results
Since this was an individual project, there were many times where I wish I could have had another person balance my crazy ideas. However, I was still able to accomplish what I set out to do. THe code could easily be improved (e.g. modularizing the graph traversal) and of course this is not the most time/space efficient. However, it did teach me a lot about the usefulness of a good data strucure.
